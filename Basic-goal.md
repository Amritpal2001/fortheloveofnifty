The motivation behind this blog is the fact that after receving graduation we all start to run for money, The basic crux of being financially independent is:: Make your Money work for you, instead of working for money.
i.e. Build some initial assets and employ those to generate a pool of growing passive income. This pool will support your goals better. And what it takes?? practically nothing. Because you are just a learned man with knowlwdge of exploiting various financial products.So let's explore the world of money together.
Take out 2 minutes to appreciate the video below and feel the essence of planning.

Happy investing
