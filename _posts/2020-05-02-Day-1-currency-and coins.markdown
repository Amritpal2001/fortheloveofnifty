so it's the day one
let's talk about money..?? What is it ??A piece of paper or an algorithmic increment of your bank balance??

so starting from the evolution of money after eradication of barter system,it has evolved to a imaginary number sitting somewhere in a server around the globe...
lets discuss some terms
1. Fungibility in simple terms it is the property of a unit of money that states that if a unit of money is divisible and all subunits have equal purchasing power with mutual substitution (one subunit can be exchanged with other.) then the unit is fungible

we define money to prefer some functions like>
Primary Functions
1. Measure of value of a service or a commodity
2. Medium of exchange
there are secondary functions like
1.Store of Value
2. Transfer of value
3. Deferred payment

so money evolved form commodity
aztecs used coco seeds as money (chocolate is still love :))
but commodity money was
1. had intrinsic value
2. was perishable
3.there were chances of hyperinflation(prices rising sky high)
4.was bulky to take with
also this did not promote division of labor. eg, everyone will grow their own coco seeds the who will do other professions..

then came metallic money or coins
The Gupta period introduced gold coins
Sher Shah Suri introduced first silver coins

now there is still a problem
the coins can be of two type
1. Full bodied(metal value=face value(face value is amount mentioned on coin))
2. token coins (value of metal < face value)

we also have a coinage act which says melting or exploiting coins can lead to 7 years of
imprisonment

there was a problem with full bodied coins
for example i have a sack full of silver coins. Also I am an evil minded man,so i'll remove little amount of silver from each coin and make sell the silver.
ex.1. the old one rupee coin(in punjabi called thullu,,yes the one of Kapil Sharma) was made of an alloy which in present day can give lead of 7 rupees.Hence it was discontinued
2.The old 5 rupee coin can be used to make razor blades worth 12 rupees,(,don't rush to mp workshop its illegal) the racquet was busted in Bangladesh.and the coin was debased.

debasement ::reducing the value of metal in coin keeping the face value same
conclusion Token coins are the best because there value is confirmed by the authority of government instead of underlying metal
