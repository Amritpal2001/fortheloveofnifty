I am a Btech student studying Information Technology @ NIT Jalandhar. Finances have always been a fascination for me.I started nuturing my financial aptitude since class 8 from the platform called NFLAT (National Financial Literacy Assesment Test) it was a basic financial aptitude test hosted by NCFE under the guidance of RBI,SEBI and other regulatories. I started as a curious kid and ended up being the North Zone winner and a national rank of 5 among half a million aspirants.I have some jewels of knowledge which I believe can only grow if Shared.
Also I would like to thank my mentor Mr. Bhupinder singh HOD-FMM MFC,M.A, M.Ed NCFM, NISM who nutured my dreams and worked for a cause, He's a true inspiration indeed.

Happy learning :).
