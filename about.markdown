I am a Btech student @ NIT Jalandhar. Finances have always been a fascination for me.I started nuturing my financial aptitude since class 8 from the platform called NFLAT (National Financial Literacy Assesment Test) it was a basic financial aptitude test hosted by NCFE under the guidance of RBI,SEBI and other regulatories. I started as a curious kid and ended up being the North Zone winner and a national rank of 5 among half a million aspirants.I have some jwells of knowledge which I believe can only grow if Shared.
Happy learning :).
